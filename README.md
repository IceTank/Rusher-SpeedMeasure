# Rusher Speed Measure Plugin

## Install
- Install as a rusherhack plugin (see rusher hack discord for more info)

## Usage
- type `*speedmeasure start` to set the first position
- type `*speedmeasure end` to calculate the distance and speed between the two positions
- type `*speedmeasure estimate <some number>` to estimate the time needed to travel the distance in blocks at the last measured speed. This can be useful when traveling along highways and wanting to know how long it will take to get to a specific waypoint
